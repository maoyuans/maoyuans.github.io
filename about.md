# About

I am a PhD candidate in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at Purdue University. I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Elena Grigorescu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/egrigore/) and [Paul Valiant](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pvaliant/).

My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, across subdisciplines including approximation algorithms, online algorithms, complexity theory, and possibly learning theory. More specifically, I describe my field of interest as 'classical algorithms that can facilitate or be facilitated by machine learning'.

Prior to joining Purdue, I received my master's degree in computer science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) in May 2020, advised by [Carl Kingsford](https://kingsfordlab.cbd.cmu.edu/). I also received my bachelor's degree in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in May 2019, with a minor in discrete mathematics.

I find algorithmic science a fascinating subject, and often analogize it to architecture. Both involves constructing complex structure with simple building blocks, giving them utility and meaning in whole. I aspire to showcase this beauty and elegance of algorithmic science to others.

I am also passionate about education. I worked as a teaching assistant for multiple courses, at both Purdue and Carnegie Mellon. I was an early team member and content manager of [CMU Computer Science Academy](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/), a project aimed at developing a free online interactive K-12 level computer science curriculum.

In my free time, I take interest in game design and storytelling. I am in particular interested in exploring and experiencing video game as a media of art, and various narrative techniques of independent games. Currently, I am designing a rogue-like deck-building dungeon crawler game with a friend. As a hobbyist writer and storyteller, I am writing a homebrew world setting and campaigns for Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), and am hosting campaigns for my friends.
