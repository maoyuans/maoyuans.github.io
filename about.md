Hello.

If you found this blog page, you probably know Raymond Song. You followed a link he posted in one of his few social media accounts, out of interest or curiosity, and fell into some sort of rabbit hole so that you actually care enough to click on the 'About?' page on the sidebar.

Better yet - you know him a little bit from here, a little bit from there, and decided to search him up. Oh, the chances that take you here - this is not a site listed on search, so either through his github page or some other magic internet portal, you stumble upon a hidden corner of the intersection between this man and the world.

What a lovely story.

Now, before the next night that I decide to get sentimental on and finish this piece of description, let me tell you this much.

You know who Raymond Song is, so I will refrain from talking about him. Through this blog, these posts, these fragmented pieces of my thought, I hope to provide an opportunity for any inquisitive mind to peak into my thoughts. My thoughts, that of the man, the mind, the soul implicitly hidden behind the name Raymond Song.

I hope you enjoy.
