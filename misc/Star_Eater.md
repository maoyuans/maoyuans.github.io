# The Star Eater

## **????a?? 14??, ?73? BA**

Xochipilli / Xochipilli / forsake us not

light in the dark / forsake us not

(Your) veiled beauty / why do you hide

Eyes disturb / the sin of knowing

(We) see the sin / the star-eater

Mother and Father / Xbeltz'aloc / forsake us not

## **Ertos 22nd, AC 1125**

Professor Martonne,

It is day 33 of the excavation. Attached are the transcripts of slate 14. 14 is the most well-preserved among all slates, so that we are able to identify all scripts and establish correspondence to their contemporary counterpart words. Do you agree with the correspondence? If so, this could be a huge linguistic breakthrough in reconstructing pre-ascension oldtongue.

14 seems to record a poem - perhaps an invocation to Xbeltz'aloc? - that describes a disaster striking the tribe. I recall our site near Millictl finding similarly fashioned slate, only missing most of its content, so it is possible that the two slates are themed similarly? I should write them to ask for their slate to be transported over.

What I find curious is that the word "star-eater" seems to be a direct concatenation of "star" and "... who eats" in contemporary oldtongue. Maybe this suggests that these words did not evolve at all over the past millenia? Compared to a lot of other linguistic evolutions, this is certainly an interesting phenomenon.

*[Hurried footsteps approach. A door is quickly slam shut, followed by heavy breathing.]*

"...hah, hahh. By the Storm, what is... what is happening?"

"Come on, *[static]* you know what to do. Snuff out the-the lights, shut the windows, be quiet. Stay quiet. Stay quiet... Stay q-quiet. Quiet. Hide."

*[Heavy breathing continues. Quick, hurried footsteps, interrupted by creaking wood planks, and an exacerbated gasp. The sound of furniture dragging against wood floor.]*

"*[unintelligible]* did I do? The Parade shouldn't be this angry - as-as long as we follow the protocols. Did I...? *[page turning]* No, no no no, not now. Keep quiet. Hide yourself."

*[Dead silence. A gasp.]* "I-it comes, The Travelers be with me..."

*[A distant humming can be heard, and quickly amplifies into a howling, snarling, wailing wind. Wooden walls and frames creak against the impact. The cacophony persists for approximately two minutes before slowly fading away, leaving only faint, but audible heavy breathing.]*

"I-is it gone? Am I- *[hurried steps]* It's so... dark. Why is it s-so dark out there..."

"I-I wonder if the others are ok. *[page turning]* I need to inform t-the Guild abou- Wait, what is-"

*[Silence.]* "...what is that screaming?"

I really don't know what the big people at the faculty are thinking with this. It's not like these go anywhere after we're back from the excavation, so why are we writing diaries like they are formal reports?

Anyhow, can't fall asleep. Of course not, not after what happened a few days ago. I'm glad that most of us are okay, I suppose, but I could've died so easily... I'm going out for a night walk, looking at the stars, and using the transcriber to write this entry.

I didn't sign up for this! Well, I did sign up for something, but... not this. 

The tinnitus - it's not getting any better, but hopefully it will soon. I am still unsettled though, despite knowing that it is just the stress playing tricks. It just feels so... uncanny and real.

Also, I feel like my eyesight is getting worse as well. Could be a side effect of stress and lack of sleep too. It's getting much harder to see around at night - almost tripped on a stray vine. I should get that checked out next time too, and hopefully it's not going to be a big problem.

And hopefully I can have some sleep tonight.

## **Helind 20th, AC 427**

The Yharnian tribals have exhibited an unusual degree of seclusion and hostility towards each other throughout history. Scholars have summarized this phenomenon of primitive tribes of Yharn with the "dark forest theory". 

Imagine a forest shrouded in eternal darkness, in which a hunter stalks and prowls, with bow and arrows loaded and primed. Suppose the lone hunter sees a stray light approaching. It is to the hunter's best interest to hide their presence, since they do not know if the source of the light is friend or foe.

Suppose further that the light draws near, revealing itself to be the lantern of a fellow hunter. The lone hunter with bow and arrow in hand should aim to eliminate the holder of the lantern as quickly as possible. Not only may they be hostile, their presence can also attract the attention of more potential enemies.

Populating the dark forest with many hunters, and the theory will apply to everyone independently. We thus have a forest filled with hunters prowling the trees like ghosts, ready to attack anyone who reveals themselves.

One hypothesis scholars have proposed as a solution to the dark forest is to reach a consensus between the hunters that they shall retain peace inbetween them to avoid mutual destruction. Should the hunters establish communications between each other, the hostility towards each other can be eliminated effectively.

However, the premise this hypothesis builds on collapses in the face of dangers beyond the collective abilities of the hunters, that roams the dark forest as apex predators, ready to devour anything that makes its presense known.

Professor Martonne,

Day 40. The slates from the Millictl site have arrived earlier today. This took the couriers longer than expected, but I can't really blame them given that they are willing to traverse the horrifying jungles.

It only took me an hour or two to figure out what the slates are about - believe it or not, these record the exact same texts with 14. ~~What is~~ The similarities extend beyond the textual content - the glyphs used are exactly identical as well, while normally regional dialects will result in multiple presentations of the same meaning.

I'm not sure what is going on here, to be honest. Does this imply some greater meaning between these two slates? Does the poem in 14 depict an event that influences across the entire Yharnic jungle? I didn't really have time to hypothesize further; ~~It's tiring~~ Sorry, I think I am still recovering from Incident 021125-I34. I should have more to elaborate on in my next report.

These report duties are getting kind of annoying. It's always write this, submit that - never anything useful. At least make us read some recent journal publishes that will have the slimmest chance to help!

But I guess there's not much to do under these blasted night skies when sleeping sound is out of the options.

It's boring. Pathetically boring. Could've counted the stars, find the constellations that Aslingarde used to teach us about; now I really have to squint to see anything through the haze. One second you find Candle VI, the next you blink and it's gone.

I don't know anymore. When can this stop? The screams and the hazes... Nethers take them, when will they stop?

## **Vupen 14th, AC 682**

The Ascendant struggles to sit up from his bed, gazing past the opened door. No longer fit in health to rule from the throne, he has retreated to his residence, surrounded by incenses and elixirs.

The guards escort in his visitor. A mad woman, ragged and unkept, laughing under her weakened breath. "Ah, yes... aren't you a sight for sore eyes! A flickering candle on his deathbed, moments away from-"

A forceful slap across the face sends her into a coughing fit.

"...Let the witch answer." The Ascendant orders, with what authority and dignity he has remaining. "Who are you to brandish these omens like a prophet of the gods?"

The witch coughs up some blood, the stains quickly prestidigitated away by a chamberlain. "A prophet I am...! Just, not of gods and mortals - the stars! That which no eyes can see, that which no ears can hear, that which you do not have domain over, ha..."

"Madness." He scoffs. "Which one of your stars did you say was...?"

"Two hours sharp before midnight, first of Ertos, 617 of the Calendar. Petrichor fifteen. A dying star."

The old man raises a brow, but gestures to the chamberlain. "It was, your highness. The court astromancers have confirmed no discord." His servant answers, chanting a spell to reveal the night sky above, through layers of marble frieze and tympanum.

The attention of those in the room shifts toward a small dot among a sea of lights, as it flickers and fades.

"Hahaha! It was prophesized as such! The Silence claims you both!" She laughs hysterically, deafening in a room void of words.

The Ascendant passed soon after.

Lord Aslingarde,

I have received your orders. Site YH4 in Sitlalchtli will be shutting down. I've sent the notice to start staff relocation procedures. No asset will be catalogued.

As a faculty of Archaeology, I do not wish to question your decisions; Yet as a scholar and researcher, I must protest against the closure of Site YH4. Excavations in YH4 has already unearthed many culturally and linguistically important artifacts, and more are being deciphered and maintained by my research group. Such a sudden closure without reason is unreasonable by all standards, and will undoubtly have a profound negative impact to the entire field.

I understand that there is a recent lack of report from the site, but there have been precedences in which external environmental circumstances have caused a temporary cease in physical courier or Sending services. If this is the reason behind your decision, I urge you to reconsider and allow at least a week of intermission.

Sincerely,  
Kulmani Martonne  
W. Hellenke Professor of Archaeology, Svard, Labyrinthine

*[Quiet sobbing.]* "Make it stop..."

*[Quiet sobbing, interrupted occasionally by short screeches of pain.]*

"Go-go away! *[unintelligible]* who's there?"

"You... I... you are...?"

"Follow you...?"

Dear members of the Faculty of Archaeology,

It is with a heavy heart that I announce that after two days of searching operations, ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■, a beloved member of our community, has tragically passed away after he went missing on Ertos 22nd, AC 1125. ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ is a Secondary Investigator stationed in Site YH4, and has contributed significantly to the serialization of pre-Ascension oldtongue. He is beloved by colleagues and friends, and will forever live on in our memories of him. 

From a more personal note, I fondly remember serving on ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■'s committee and having many passionate debates then as an acting professor. He was a brilliant student and a very good friend. My condolences go out to his family and friends.

I wish to remind everyone that the Faculty of Archaeology, the Department of Spiritual Advention, and Labyrinthine as a whole all provides many support resources in these times of hardness. I urge any faculty, staff, or student to seek out these resources, or contact a counselor to schedule a consultation session, should there be need, of themselves, or of their friends and colleagues. 

May the Bringer of Arcane watch over all of us.

Lord Lenska Svard  
Ertos 28th, AC 1125

## **Sometime, Somewhere**

Yes, I hear the screams too.

...

Yes, I hear their pain and sorrow.

...

Will I be one of them?  
Will I be screaming too?

...

Yes, I can see stars.  
I see them extinguished. Devoured. Eaten alive.  
But their scream remains.

...

I understand.  
I must hide from it. I must be quiet.  
I will be silent. I will be blind.

...

Yes, I see stars no longer.

...

Yes, I hear screaming no longer.

...

Yes, I love them too.
